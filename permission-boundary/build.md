# Permission Boundaries: How to Truly Delegate Permissions on AWS (Build Phase)

Permission boundaries is probably one of the most important new IAM features that has launched in a while. This feature addresses a longstanding customer issue, namely, how do I delegate administration to my users. If you have system administrators that need to be able to create IAM roles and users, developers that need to be able to create roles for Lambda functions, or any similar scenario, then you need permission boundaries.

## Environment Setup

??? note "AWS Sponsored Event"
    * Browse to the URL provided to you and login. 
    * After you login click the **AWS Account** box, then click on the Account ID displayed below that (the red box in the image.) You should see a link below that for the **Management console**. Click on that and you will be taken to the AWS console.

??? note "Individual"

    Launch the CloudFormation stack below to setup the Permission Boundary environment:

    Region| Deploy
    ------|-----
    US West 2 (Oregon) | <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/new?stackName=Identity-PB-Builder-Session&templateURL=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sa-security-specialist-workshops-us-west-2/builder-sessions/permissionboundary/permission-boundaries-env.yml" target="_blank">![Deploy in us-west-2](./images/deploy-to-aws.png)</a>

    1. Click the **Deploy to AWS** button above.  This will automatically take you to the console to run the template.  

    2. Click **Next** on the **Specify Template**, **Specify Details, and **Options** sections.

    3. Finally, acknowledge that the template will create IAM roles under **Capabilities and click **Create**.

    This will bring you back to the CloudFormation console. You can refresh the page to see the stack starting to create. Before moving on, make sure the stack is in a **CREATE_COMPLETE**.

## Scenario

![login-page](./images/pb-scenario.png)

As the administrator for an AWS account hosting multiple production applications, you've been tasked with creating a new administrator role to delegate some of your responsibilities.  This new role will be responsible for doing all the administration on the resources for the **Ares Mission**.  The diagram above showcases the two applications currently being hosted in the AWS account and their associated resources. Currently there is only one application related to the Ares Mission but there is a plan to migrate three more applications for this mission by the end of the year.  The new role should account for current and future Ares Mission applications to reduce your overhead and friction with the web administrators.

The web administrators for the Ares Mission should have permissions to create and administer resources related to that mission.  This means they should be able to:

1. Create, modify, and delete IAM policies and roles.  Any role created must have restricted permissions to ensure a web administrator cannot elevate their privileges or the privileges of the application.
2. Create, modify, and delete Ares Mission Lambda functions.

The web administrators should not be able to impact any resources in the account that are not part of the Ares Mission application including users, groups, roles, S3 buckets, EC2 instances, etc.  In this case, they should not be able to modify resources of the Rover Mission.

> All resources are located in the **us-west-2** region.

## Task 1 - Create a permission boundary for Lambda Functions

**ACTION**: Create a new IAM policy that will act as the permission boundary for the web admins. Name the policy **`identity-ex-permissionboundary-ares-lambda`**

>  **Hint**: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html" target="_blank">Friendly Names and Paths
</a>. The question marks **`????`** in the resource element below should be replaced with something that could act as a resource restriction. 

``` json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "CreateLogGroup",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "logs:CreateLogGroup",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:us-west-2:ACCOUNT_ID:*"
        },

            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::identity-ex-????"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Task 2 - Create a permission policy for the Web Admin

**ACTION**: Create the permission policy that will be attached to the **webadmin** AWS IAM user. Name the new policy **`identity-ex-webadmin-permissionpolicy`**.

            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Task 3 - Create the Web Admin user

**ACTION**:

* Create an IAM User and name it `webadmin`. The user will need console access so give it a password.
* Attach the **identity-ex-webadmin-permissionpolicy**, **IAMReadOnlyAccess** & **AWSLambdaReadOnlyAccess** policies to the IAM user.

When you are done the **webadmin** user should have three policies attached: identity-ex-webadmin-permissionpolicy, IAMReadOnlyAccess & AWSLambdaReadOnlyAccess.

## Task 4 - Gather info needed for the Verify phase

**ACTION**: Now that you have setup the IAM user for the web admins, it's time to pass this information on to the next team who will work through the **VERIFY** tasks. You need to gather some details about your IAM user and then hand this info to the next team.

Copy the **IAM users sign-in link**, the IAM user name (if you used a name other then **webadmin**) and the password you used. You will also need the resource restriction that you used in your policies and the name you used for the permission policy and permission boundary (if you used names other than the ones recommended above)

Here are all of the details you need to pass to another team:

* IAM users sign-in link:   
* IAM user name:    
* IAM user password:    
* Resource restriction identifier:  
* Permission boundary name: (recommended name: **identity-ex-permissionboundary-ares-lambda**)
* Permission policy: (recommended name: **identity-ex-webadmin-permissionpolicy**)

Enter this information into the **VERIFY** phase form and exchange forms with another team so you both can work through the tasks.

You can now move on to the **Verify** phase!
